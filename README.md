Jersey City Citibike Bikeshare Pre and Post Covid Analysis
Technical Write Up

OVERVIEW

The project goal was to compare and contrast rider patters and changes is bikeshare demand in a pre and post covid environment The data set we are looking at is publicly available system data files from the Citibike System Data website. Using this data, I analyzed activity levels, defined customer types, and created definitions for supply and demand based on rider utilization. With the growing sales and popularity of personal bicycles and with cities investing more in bicycle safety and infrastructure, coupled with more flexible working hours and more personal commuting time, I hypothesized that the growing popularity would have a positive impact on bikeshare participation. 


OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS
-	Usage is up: Bikeshare program is seeing a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8% per year since 2019.
-	Increase in Range: Total Radius (range) of stations was 2.8 Miles, up .7 miles from 2.1 Miles in 2019. (25%) increase. 
-	Increase in stations: 33 new stations since 2019. New stations now account for 44% of all new rides. New stations are balancing the demand by improving range and availability.
-	Riders are traveling greater distances: Total Radius (range) of stations was 2.8 Miles, up .7 miles from 2.1 Miles in 2019. (25%) increase.
-	Travel Time is up 50%: driven by number of leisure rides but also effected by the increase range and station availability.
-	Increasing Number of Non Subscribers: gaining 20% share of ridership (accounting for 30% of all rides) with increased weekday and afternoon rides during the summer months. Further investigation into ride time being down 27%, look at effect of price rates.
-	Electric Bikes: Introduced in May 2020 and already accounting for 14% of bikes and 30% of total rides!

OVERVIEW OF PROJECT RECOMMENDATIONS
-	Bikeshare is growing at 8% per year: The increase in demand will be about 150k new trips by 2024
o	With the average stations doing 10k trips per year, we recommend adding 15 new stations in 24 months
-	With Demand increasing near popular transit centers
o	We recommend expanding station capacity at current locations (in pink)
-	Non-Subscribers and Leisure Rides
o	Convert non-subscribers with focus on summer, weekday rides with extended use periods 1 hour and 20 minutes <. 
-	Electric Bikes: 8 months new and 30% of total trip share!
o	Add e-Bikes to the fleet as cost vs benefit options. Ave new e-bike retails for $1,000 (+ cost, effort and time to maintain and store)
o	Bikeshare offers cost-benefit: Offers 4,600 trips vs cost of new bike
o	Ave Trip (.8miles) x .27c Mile = 4,600 trips for equal value
